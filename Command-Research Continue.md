# Lab Report 5 --- Research More Command

> In this lab report, I will investigate **echo** command

## Option1: -n
*-n option will omit the new line after the output*

*Source: https://linuxhint.com/bash_echo/*

Example1:
```
Command:
      echo -n "Java is"; echo "interpreted as object-oriented language"
Result:
      Java is interpreted as object-oriented language 
      (two echo commands should print in two lines, but one with -n)
If we don't use -n option, it would be like:
      Java is
      interpreted as object-oriented language
```

Example2:
```
Command:
      echo -n "Hello World"
Result: 
      Hello WorldAndyWeasleydeMacBook-Pro:VS Code yaomingyang$ 
      (The title of next line appears in this line,
      which means all content behind string input is omitted)
If we don't use -n option, it would be like:
      Hello World
      AndyWeasleydeMacBook-Pro:VS Code yaomingyang$ 
```

## Option2: -e
*-e option will enabled the function of backslash(\), and the output is generated by adding ‘tab’ space where ‘\t’ is used in the string.
Also, the output will add a new line where '\n' is used, and there are other escape sequence that works*

*Source: https://linuxhint.com/bash_echo/*

Example1 (\n - New line):
```
Command:
      echo -e "Hello\nWorld"
Result: 
      Hello
      World 
      (there is new line instead of a space between two words)
If we don't use -e option, the result would be like:
      Hello\nWorld
```

Example2 (\t - Tab):
```
Command:
      echo -e "Java\tis\tinterpreted\tas\tobject-oriented\tlanguage"
Result: 
      Java    is      interpreted     as      object-oriented language
      (there is tab instead of a space between two words)
If we don't use -e option, the result would be like:
      Java\tis\tinterpreted\tas\tobject-oriented\tlanguage
 ```
 
Example3 (\v):
```
Command:
      echo -e "Java\vis\vinterpreted\vas\vobject-oriented\vlanguage"
Result: 
Java
    is
      interpreted
                 as
                   object-oriented
                                  language
      (It prints out each word vertically)
If we don't use -e option, the result would be like:
      Java\vis\vinterpreted\vas\vobject-oriented\vlanguage
```

Example4 (\c)
```
Command:
      echo -e "Hello\cWorld"
Result: 
      HelloAndyWeasleydeMacBook-Pro:VS Code yaomingyang$
      (Remaining is my laptop info, and the rest of line
      is omitted)
If we don't use -e option, the result would be like:
      Hello\cWorld
```

## Option3: -E
*-E option will stop interpret any backslash as escape sequences*

*Source: https://linuxhint.com/bash_echo/*

Example1:
```
Command:
      echo -E "C:\\Program Files\\"
Result:
      C:\Program Files\
      (one \ is omited)      
```

Example2:
```
Command:
      echo -E "Hello\nWorld"
Result:
      Hello\nWorld
      (\n is seen as normal string)
```

Generally, echo command only has above three main options, and the introductions above, in my opinion, includes most information about echo.
