# Lab Report 5 --- Research More Command

> In this lab report, I will investigate **echo** command

## Option1: -n
*-n option will omit the new line after the output

*Source: https://linuxhint.com/bash_echo/

Example1:
```
echo -n "Java is interpreted as object-oriented language"
Result:
      Java is interpreted as object-oriented languageAndyWeasleydeMacBook-Pro:VS Code yaomingyang$ 
If we don't use -n option, it would be like:
      Java is interpreted as object-oriented language
      AndyWeasleydeMacBook-Pro:VS Code yaomingyang$ 

```
